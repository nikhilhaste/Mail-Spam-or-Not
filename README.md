# Spam Detection 

Problem Statement

In the digital world, we receive a large number of emails every day, the majority of which
are irrelevant to us and some of which include questionable links that may damage our
system in one way or another. Spam detection can be used to get around this. It involves
identifying if an email is legitimate or whether it is spam of some type. Delivering relevant
emails to the individual and separating junk emails are the goals of spam detection. Every
email service provider already includes spam detection, but it is not always particularly
accurate, occasionally, it labels useful emails as spam.
Since spammers began employing sophisticated strategies to get past spam filters, like
using random sender addresses or attaching random characters to the start or end of email
subjects, the battle between the filtering system and spammers has become intense.
Machine learning with a model-oriented approach lacks activity prediction development.
Since then, spam has taken up storage space and transmission capacity while wasting
users' time by forcing them to sort through junk mail. The rules in other ones that are
already in place must be continuously updated and maintained, which makes it
burdensome for some users and challenging to manually compare the accuracy of
classified data.
